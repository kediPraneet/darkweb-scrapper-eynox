## 2. Investigation Artifacts

| Artifact Type | Value / Example | Context from Source |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Marketplace Names** | DwebStore, HackerStars, Carders Haven, Find a Hacker (FAH), Kuiper, Money Transfer Hackers | Multiple listings across different onion sites (see sources 2‑4, 8‑11, 12, 14, 15). |
| **Product Types** | • Credit‑Card dumps (CC numbers, CVV, expiry)  <br>• PayPal account credentials & balance transfer services  <br>• CashApp logs (full login, phone, balance screenshots)  <br>• Bank‑log credentials  <br>• Hacked database dumps (AT&T, Adobe, AdultFriendFinder, etc.)  <br>• Hacked Bitcoin wallet seeds (private keys, seed‑phrases) | Extracted from product listings (sources 1, 2‑4, 5, 6). |
| **Payment Methods** | Bitcoin (BTC), USDT‑TRC20, Monero (XMR) | Stated on every marketplace page (e.g., source 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9). |
| **Price Ranges** | • CC dump: $1‑$5 per card (example: $2.023 USD)  <br>• PayPal balance cash‑out: $10 USD fee  <br>• CashApp $1k account: $100 USD  <br>• Database dumps: $13‑$258 USD (depending on size)  <br>• Hacked BTC wallet: “10‑50 % of balance” (no fixed price) | Directly quoted in listings (source 1, 5, 3, 6). |
| **Technical Indicators** | • “Socks5 Internal UID” (source 1)  <br>• “Verified” badge on CashApp logs (source 3)  <br>• “Escrow‑free” sales model (source 1)  <br>• “Instant Digital Delivery” (source 3, 7, 8) | Indicate service delivery mechanisms and trust signals used by vendors. |
| **Potential Threat Actor Alias** | **RitomDeka** – *not directly observed* in the supplied data. | No explicit mention; however, the pattern of multiple “verified” vendors suggests the alias could be a seller or a buyer operating on any of the above markets. |
| **Associated Infrastructure** | • Re‑used DwebStore onion addresses (three mirrors)  <br>• Common payment wallets (BTC/USDT) – likely shared across listings  <br>• Use of JavaScript‑enabled Tor security settings (standard/safer) to enable cart functionality | Consistent UI/UX across mirrors indicates a shared backend or affiliate network. |
| **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)** | • Offering “instant delivery” after crypto payment → automated credential vending  <br>• Use of “escrow‑free” model → reduces buyer friction, increases transaction speed  <br>• Advertising “verified” status → social‑proof to attract buyers  <br>• Bulk data dump sales → monetisation of large‑scale breaches | Observed across multiple marketplaces (sources 1, 2‑5, 6). |

## 3. Key Insights

| # | Insight | Evidence |
|---|----------|----------|
| **1** | **Proliferation of CashApp‑log marketplaces** – At least **four distinct onion sites** (DwebStore mirrors, Carders Haven, Money Transfer Hackers) are actively selling verified CashApp accounts with balances ranging from $500 to $5,000. | Sources 2‑4, 7‑9, 11, 14. |
| **2** | **Standardised crypto‑only payment ecosystem** – All vendors accept **Bitcoin, USDT‑TRC20, and/or Monero**, with no fiat or alternative payment options. This creates a tightly coupled financial flow that can be tracked on public blockchains. | Sources 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. |
| **3** | **Large‑scale data‑breach dump marketplace** – The “Hacked Databases” site (source 5) lists **over 30 distinct breach collections** (e.g., AT&T, Adobe, AdultFriendFinder) with **prices as low as $13 USD**, indicating commoditisation of personal data. | Source 5. |
| **4** | **Potential affiliate/white‑label operation** – Identical product catalogues, UI wording (“Verified”, “Instant Delivery”), and identical pricing appear across three DwebStore onion mirrors (sources 2, 7, 8, 9). This suggests a **single operator or affiliate network** re‑hosting the same inventory to increase resilience. | Sources 2, 7, 8, 9. |
| **5** | **No direct reference to “RitomDeka”** – The supplied OSINT does **not contain the alias**. However, the presence of multiple vendor platforms and the practice of using **pseudonymous usernames** means the alias could be a **seller, buyer, or escrow escrow‑service** on any of these markets. | Entire data set. |

## 4. Next Steps & Suggested Queries

| Action | Rationale | Example Search / Query |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| **A. Direct search for “RitomDeka” on each marketplace** | The alias may be hidden behind a vendor profile or product listing. | `site:*.onion "RitomDeka"` – run via Tor‑enabled search engines (Ahmia, Phobos). |
| **B. Monitor cryptocurrency wallets linked to the marketplaces** | Payments are crypto‑only; tracing incoming/outgoing transactions can reveal wallet addresses used by the alias. | Identify BTC/USDT addresses advertised on the sites (e.g., via page source) and set up blockchain alerts (e.g., via BlockCypher, Whale Alert). |
| **C. Harvest vendor email/Telegram contacts** | Many markets provide “email me for clone cards” or Telegram handles; these may contain the alias. | Scrape “Email me for clone cards” links and parse for usernames; look for “RitomDeka” in the address part. |
| **D. Conduct passive DNS / SSL certificate analysis on the onion domains** | Re‑used infrastructure can be linked to other hidden services where the alias may appear. | Use tools like `onionscan` to enumerate sub‑domains, certificate CNs, and compare with known threat‑actor infrastructure. |
| **E. Set up honeypot accounts on CashApp/PayPal** | To capture credential dumps and possibly link them to the alias when they appear in future listings. | Create low‑balance CashApp accounts, monitor marketplace listings for matching balances or screenshots. |
| **F. Expand search to external forums & Telegram channels** | Many vendors advertise on public dark‑web forums or private Telegram groups. | Query: `"RitomDeka" AND (CashApp OR PayPal OR "credit card")` on Telegram search bots, Reddit’s r/DarkNetMarkets, and specialized OSINT tools (e.g., Maltego, SpiderFoot). |
| **G. Review “HackerStars” and “Find a Hacker” profiles** | These platforms list individual hacker profiles; the alias could be a service provider. | Browse vendor listings, filter by “ranked” or “verified” and look for the name. |

### Closing Note
While the current OSINT dump does not directly reveal the **RitomDeka** alias, the surrounding ecosystem is rich with **credential‑vending services**, **large‑scale data dumps**, and **crypto‑only payment flows**. Targeted probing of the identified marketplaces, combined with blockchain monitoring and broader dark‑web forum surveillance, should increase the likelihood of locating any activity tied to the alias.
