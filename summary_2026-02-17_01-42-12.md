| **Onion C2 Dashboard** | `http://ssg3qvvu62kjmmltvlt574vdmv5jnklya3kqgefbvk7bpgjxyfe7vbqd.onion` | “FREE Anonymous C2 Dashboard via Onion to manage your Clients”. |
| **Package / Pricing** | **Elite Package – $1,200 USD** (12‑month C2 access) | Includes C# FUD ransomware, AES‑256 encryption, 64‑char key, no affiliate fees. |
| **Version History** | v1.85 (2024/1), v2.00 (2024/4), v2.15 (2024/6), v2.30 (2024/9), v2.45 (2025/1) | Shows continuous development and release cadence. |
| **Technical Features** | Delayed start, delayed encryption, mutex, task‑manager/registry disabler, UAC bypass, desktop‑wallpaper changer, IP tracking, offline encryption, unkillable process/BSOD, optional file‑type selection, dropper add‑on, clone add‑on, extra crypter/obfuscator. |
| **Add‑On Modules (Free)** | Dropper (execute arbitrary EXE), Clone (fresh copy with same C2), FUD+ (extra obfuscation), Unkillable Process (BSOD). |
| **Crypto Donation Addresses** (from ransomware‑group list) | **DOGE:** `DBPbrvFShnykgBa8svQ91F9Vgs1zhhgmB1`<br>**LTC:** `LXMDziBcT474Mava74r9BvkTyoXcaUk6MD`<br>**BTC/BCH:** `1FyCD8kp9ekiTTgdyhFtZRgzR1QCHV4i84`<br>**XMR:** `48FgeW4fUpyjPDGxJdHaA441F5c9szYtLSVWbNv8T3ZXe9ZN3iLUSSdASof2vDQqdbgRYom9aMeQMWPQkr3SPZUJE2uM8fc` | Listed under “Ransomware Group Sites” page – likely the operators’ payout wallets. |

### 4. Key Insights  

| # | Insight | Why it matters / Actionability |
|---|---------|--------------------------------|
| **1** | **RANION is being sold as a turnkey RaaS with a *no‑fee* model** – the vendor explicitly states they take **no fees from affiliates** and provide a free C2 dashboard. | Lowers the entry barrier for low‑skill criminals, potentially increasing the volume of attacks. Monitoring the C2 dashboard (if accessible) can reveal active victim IDs and encryption keys. |
| **2** | **Pricing is modest ($1,200 for 12 months)** and includes a suite of free add‑ons (dropper, clone, extra obfuscation). | The price point suggests the operator targets a broad affiliate base, not just elite groups. Budget‑constrained threat actors can afford it, expanding the threat surface. |
| **3** | **Active development cycle** – five releases from v1.85 to v2.45 within ~16 months, each labeled “re‑FUD”. | Continuous updates indicate a responsive development team that may be patching detection evasion gaps. Security products should treat RANION as a *moving target* and update signatures regularly. |
| **4** | **Crypto‑wallets for donations are publicly listed** (DOGE, LTC, BTC/BCH, XMR). | These addresses can be monitored on blockchain explorers for inflows that correlate with known RANION incidents, providing a financial‑flow intelligence feed. |
| **5** | **Overlap with other ransomware listings** (LockBit, Psoglav) on the same “Ransomware Group Sites” page suggests a possible **affiliation marketplace** where multiple RaaS operators advertise side‑by‑side. | Threat‑intel teams should treat the “Group Sites” page as a hub for emerging RaaS offerings; cross‑referencing victim reports with the list can reveal new actors quickly. |

### 5. Next Steps  

| Step | Recommended Action | Example Search / Query |
|------|--------------------|------------------------|
| **A. C2 Dashboard Recon** | Access the onion C2 dashboard (if public) to enumerate active victim IDs, key‑exchange timestamps, and any leaked decryption keys. | `curl -s -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 http://ssg3qvvu62kjmmltvlt574vdmv5jnklya3kqgefbvk7bpgjxyfe7vbqd.onion/dashboard` |
| **B. Crypto‑Wallet Monitoring** | Set up blockchain alerts for the listed donation addresses to detect spikes in inflow that may correspond to ransomware payouts. | Use services like WhaleAlert, BlockCypher API: `GET /address/1FyCD8kp9ekiTTgdyhFtZRgzR1QCHV4i84` |
| **C. Sample Acquisition** | Search public malware repositories (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis) for “RANION” or the specific version strings (e.g., “RANION v2.30”) to obtain binaries for sandbox analysis. | `site:virustotal.com "RANION v2.30"` |
| **D. Leak‑Site Correlation** | Scrape the “Ransomware Group Sites” page for any linked leak portals; monitor them for data dumps that contain the RANION ransom note or encryption marker. | `grep -i "RANION" *` on downloaded HTML of the page. |
| **E. Affiliate Network Mapping** | Cross‑reference the e‑mail `Thegreeneye@dnmx.cc` and other service listings (e.g., “The green eye” hacking services) with known ransomware affiliate forums to identify possible partnership or recruitment channels. | Search dark‑web forums: `thegreeneye@dnmx.cc` + “RANION” |
| **F. Threat‑Intel Sharing** | Publish an IODEF/STIX bundle containing the onion C2 URL, crypto addresses, and observed TTPs (e.g., “Delayed Encryption”, “UAC Bypass”) to industry sharing platforms (ISACs, MISP). | Generate STIX objects for each artifact. |
| **G. Continuous OSINT** | Schedule periodic crawls of the RANION sales page and the “Ransomware Group Sites” hub to capture new version releases or price changes. | Use a Tor‑enabled scraper with a cron job (e.g., every 48 h). |
